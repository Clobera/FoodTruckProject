# Food Truck Project

## Description
This project was done during my second week of my java full stack bootcamp cohort SD36.
The program asks a user to input up to 5 food trucks to get a rating. The user enters the name, what type of food it is, and what they rate it on a scale from 1 to 5. After the user is finished entering the number of food trucks desired(up to 5), the user is prompted to enter another input based on the menu that is displayed. That menu provides options to list all of the food trucks entered, the average rating from all food trucks, the highest rated food truck, and finally to quit the program.

### AH-HA MOMENTS:
<li> Always remember to flush!
<li> When I got the information from the user and stored them in a variable and passed them to the FoodTruck constructor was a big ah ha moment. I finally understood what a constructor does!
<li> The Getters and Setters were also a big ah ha moment, because i didnt understand what "this." was refering to until i coded it myself and got it to work.



### Thanks for running my code!
