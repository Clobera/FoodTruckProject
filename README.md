# Food Truck Project


## Overview

This is a Java program that allows users to rate up to five different food trucks based on their name, type of food, and rating (on a scale of 1-5). The program then allows the user to perform several different actions, including:

- Listing all of the food trucks entered
- Calculating the average rating for all food trucks
- Identifying the highest rated food truck
- Quitting the program


## How to Use

To use the program, the user simply runs the Java file in a command prompt or IDE, and follows the prompts to enter information about each food truck. Once the user has entered all desired food trucks, they can choose from a menu of options to view various statistics about the ratings entered.

For example, if a user enters the following food trucks:

1. Taco Truck, Mexican, 4
2. Burger Joint, American, 3
3. Sushi Stop, Japanese, 5

They could then choose to view the highest rated food truck (Sushi Stop), the average rating of all food trucks (4), or list all food trucks entered.

## Technologies Used

The program uses a combination of the following Java features:

- Constructors
- Getters and Setters
- For loops
- While loops
- Methods with arguments
- Arrays of Objects

In addition, the following tools were used to develop and manage the project:

- Java
- Git for version control
- GitHub for project hosting and collaboration

## Learning Outcomes

During the development of this project, I gained experience with:

- Object-oriented programming concepts in Java
- Using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Creating and managing arrays of objects
- Implementing control structures such as for and while loops
- Creating and using methods with arguments
- Creating and using constructors and getters/setters

## Next Steps

In future iterations of this project, I plan to:

- Implement additional options for sorting and manipulating the data
- Add more detailed error messages and input validation to improve the robustness of the program

Thank you for considering my project!
