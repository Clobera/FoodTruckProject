# Food Truck Project

## Description
This project was done during my second week of my java full stack bootcamp cohort.
The program asks a user to input up to 5 food trucks to get a rating. the user enters the name, type of food it is, and what they rate it on a scale from one to 5.

### What is used:
<li> Constructors
<li> Getters and Setters
<li> For loops
<li> While loops
<li> Methods with arguments
<li> Arrays of Objects

### Software used: 
<li> Java
<li> Github
<li> Git
	
	
	
	
	
	
### AH-HA MOMENTS:
<li> Always remember to flush!
<li> When I got the information from the user and stored them in a variable and passed them to the FoodTruck constructor was a big ah ha moment. I finally understood what a constructor does!
<li> The Getters and Setters were also a big ah ha moment, because i didnt understand what "this." was refering to until i coded it myself and got it to work.



### Thanks for running my code!
